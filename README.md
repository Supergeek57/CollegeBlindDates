# CollegeBlindDates
Holland's side project to help high schoolers discover the college that is (actually) the right fit for them.

Hey there! Are you a high school student looking for your right-fit college? You've come to the right place! College Safari is a web app all about debunking the myth that Ivy(+) schools are the end-all and be-all of the college decision process. We try to turn it into the college *exploration* process instead, by giving the power back to YOU, the student, to pick the school that is the right fit for you. Our main (free) service, College Blind Dates, uses an OpenAI model to introduce you to schools that you might not have known about that could be a great fit! The catch is that the model won't tell you the name of the school until you ask some follow-up questions to learn more about it. It also won't return schools with less than a 20% acceptance rate--not at all to say that those can't be a fit for you, but you already know about them, and we want to introduce you to new potential options.
