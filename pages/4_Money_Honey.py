## Things to know about paying for college:

- Everyone's situation is different and equally valid. There's nothing wrong with money being an important factor in your college decision--or not being a factor at all! 
- Need-based and merit-based aid are both great ways to help pay for college, but some schools allocate more funding to one type of aid than the other. Work smarter, not harder--figure out whether you qualify for need-based aid early in the process so you can identify schools that are a good financial fit.
- Resources like net price calculators can help you estimate the cost of a specific school so you aren't caught by surprise when you see the final bill, but they're most helpful for people who (a) are eligible for some need-based aid and (b) have a typical family situation with average income/assets.
- External scholarships can be great funding sources as well! Just like with college-specific scholarships, some are need-based and some don't consider financial situation. Do your research and know what you're eligible for before applying!
- For students who qualify for need-based aid: Need-blind and meets-needs are two different things! Need-blind means a school won't be less likely to admit you because you would need a lot of aid to afford attending. Meets-needs means that a school will meet your full "demonstrated need" (as calculated by the FAFSA or the CSS, which is a similar but more annoying financial aid form.) If a school is need-blind but doesn't meet full need, you could end up with a financial aid package that's mostly loans, which isn't ideal.

## Do I qualify for need-based aid?

- You can fill out the FAFSA and get an EFC (Expected Family Contribution) to get an estimate for how much colleges that use the FAFSA in their aid calculations will expect you to pay. If the amount seems ridiculously high, don't freak out! See below for a quick explanation of why this could happen.
- Net price calculators will give you a rough (but less accurate) estimate of how much aid you qualify for.
- If you have a unique financial situation (parents living in different locations, higher than normal family assets, etc.), you may see an expected family contribution that seems disproportionately high. This is because the FAFSA (and most colleges' financial aid algorithms) are designed for a standard "template" that applies to *most* family financial structures, and often can't handle nontraditional situations. This means you will almost certainly not qualify for need-based aid, but the great news is that there are lots of schools with amazing merit scholarships. If you're chasing merit, see my list of schools with great merit scholarships below, and choose "chasing merit" in the CollegeGPT quiz when you request your next blind date! 

## Some schools with great merit scholarships 
(including out-of-state students!)

- University of Alabama (Roll Tide!): Literally automatic scholarships for getting a certain GPA and test score. No competition, no essays, no nothing! National Merit Finalists get a full ride, including on-campus housing for 4 years and tuition for 5 years.
- University of Kentucky: Same thing as Alabama, but a little less generous on the automatic scholarships--the highest scholarships are competitive. 
- University of Arizona: Variety of competitive scholarships and generous awards for National Merit semifinalists and finalists.
- University of South Carolina: Carolina Elite program with multiple tiers of merit scholarships, all of which are competitive.
- University of Oklahoma: Has automatic scholarships and full ride for NMF, similar to Alabama.
