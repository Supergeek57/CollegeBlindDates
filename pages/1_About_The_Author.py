Hi, I'm Holland! I'm a rising junior at the University of Alabama, studying computer science and math. I love building cool tech tools to help simplify people's lives, and I'm specifically interested in learning more about large language models like ChatGPT and Gemini. I created College Safari because I have seen way too many amazing high school students get pressured to go to a 'prestigious' school by both their peers and adults in their life. I faced some of this myself my senior year of high school, but my friends who attended Ivy prep-oriented high schools had it far worse. This kind of pressure is incredibly problematic because it can make students feel forced into choosing a college that isn't the best long-term-fit, or even making a financial decision that could have lifelong negative repercussions. Students should feel empowered to pick the school that will best contribute to their future success--personally, professionally, and financially. I hope College Safari can fight the 'Ivy or Bust' myth and help students reclaim the excitement that should come with exploring new colleges--who knows what you could discover on your blind date?
